# Work Clock
A widget for keeping track of how much time you spend working and when. Can be paused for breaks, and saves interesting work session information.

## Usage


## Notable features
* Saves daily information: date, start_time, stop_time and total hours worked in a local sqlite database.

* The clock can be paused, and information on every work session is saved in a local sqlite database.

* Tracks and displays the completion percentage during the workday.

* The completion percentage is customizeable, so you can set your own daily goal of hours to work.
